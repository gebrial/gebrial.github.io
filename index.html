      <h2>Goal</h2>

      <p>The goal of this website is just to create something worthy of the internet. In the coming days and weeks I will add whatever projects I am working on as best I can and a short biography about myself.</p>

      <p>I am currently working through learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript for the purposes of front-end development. After I have a handle on them I will start with the basics of back-end/full-stack development.</p>

      <p>Stay tuned for more.</p>
