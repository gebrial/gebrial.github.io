      <h2>Learnings</h2>

      <p>This page will become populated with anything I learn about programming. Basically, I will regurgitate whatever I learned in my own words. This helps all of us in many ways.</p>

      <p>Teaching is said to be one of the best ways to solidify your knowledge. It helps you remember minutae that you might have otherwise forgotten. It encourages you to learn about the details you might not otherwise be interested in.</p>

      <p>My goal is to make this into a blog type section, however, I don't have the skills for that at this time. This entire website will evolve as I learn more about the languages, but for now it will be somewhat primitive.</p>

      <h3>Semantics</h3>
      <h4>11:38, Tuesday, April 28, 2015.</h4>

      <p>In HTML, certain elements are used that aid in more than making the web page look nice. They help to give meaning to the different parts and texts in the webpage.</p>

      <p id="textBlocks">One such element is the <i>section</i> element. Everything in the certain block of text that is related can be placed into one section so that it is 'held together', so to speak. Another element is the <i>article</i>. This element is used for smaller blocks of text that can be read outside of the rest of the text and still make sense. These elements help search engines categorize our website. Search engines can drive a lot of traffic to your website so play nice.</p>

      <section id="elementPairs">
        <p id="italicize">There are also pairs of elements that appear to do the same thing but actually have slightly different uses. The first that springs to mind are the <i>italicize</i> elements. There are two versions of this. The first only italicizes the contained block of text. It has the element name of <i>i</i>. It is used only when you want to convey a different tone of voice to the reader, almost as if the text had quotes around it. The second version has the element name of <i>em</i>, as in emphasis. This also italicizes the contained text, but it also has a meaning to it. As the name suggests, it gives a stressed emphasis to the word.</p>

        <p id="bolding">The second pair of such elements are the <b>bold</b> elements. The first version simply bolds the contained text. It is purely for offsetting the text and suggests no overly important value of the contained text. It is given the element name of <b>b</b>. The second version also bolds the text but adds a strong importance to the contained text. As such, it's element name is <b>strong</b>.</p>

      <h3>Git Basics</h3>
      <h4>13:56, Wednesday, April 29, 2015.</h4>

      <p>Highly suggested pre-reading: <a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2009/05/19/the-git-parable.html">The Git Parable</a>. This 'short-story' will teach you the motivations behind creating and using a version control system. It does a very good job of explaining it and motivating you to use a vcs so take 30 minutes and go it.</p>

      <p>More to be added...</p>
