      <h2>Learnings</h2>

      <p>This page will become populated with anything I learn about programming. Basically, I will regurgitate whatever I learned in my own words. This helps all of us in many ways.</p>

      <p>Teaching is said to be one of the best ways to solidify your knowledge. It helps you remember minutae that you might have otherwise forgotten. It encourages you to learn about the details you might not otherwise be interested in.</p>

      <p>My goal is to make this into a blog type section, however, I don't have the skills for that at this time. This entire website will evolve as I learn more about the languages, but for now it will be somewhat primitive.</p>

      <h3>SQL Basics: <i>select</i> and <i>insert</i> Keywords</h3>
      <h4>20:00, Wednesday, April 29, 2015.</h4>

      <p>Two very important keywords in the sql database language are select and insert. <i>select</i> allows you to request information from the database and <i>insert</i> allows you to deposit information into the database.</p>

      <p>You must first specify the name of the column to withdraw and then the name of the database with the keyword <i>from</i>, e.g., <code>select colm1 from dtbs1</code>. You can select multiple columns and databases, each separated by a comma. Selecting multiple databases requires combining one column from each database using the <i>where</i> keyword and an assignment operator, '='. If there are two columns with the same name in different databases, you must specify which database your desired column comes from with a dot operator, e.g., <code>select dtbs1.colm1, dtbs2.colm1 from dtbs1, dtbs2 where dtbs1.colm3 = dtbs2.colm4</code>.</p>

      <p>A database is essentially a table, and a table is no use if you cannot order it. Thus enters the <i>order by</i> keyword. It accepts a column name as it's first parameter and an optional <i>desc</i> parameter to switch the order.</p>

      <p>You can also create a new column as you request for information. These are functions that take in a column name as a parameter in brackets. The functions include <code>count</code>, <code>max</code>, <code>min</code>, etc.. On their own these functions act on the entire database and return a single result. However, they can be made to act on a specific column and return a value for each unique item in the column. This is done by also include the <code>group by</code> keyword. It is followed by a column name.</p>

      <p>You can also use the <code>where</code> keyword to limit the output to database entries that only have a specific value. This is also done with an assignment operator. Multiple assignments are separated by an <code>and</code> keyword. However, you cannot use this method with newly created columns as <code>where</code> only acts on the original database. You must use the <code>having</code> keyword to act on any new columns that are created. It is used in the same way as <code>where</code>.</p>

      <p>Creating multiple pages of databases is also a breeze with sql. We just use the keyword <code>limit</code> in conjunction with <code>offset</code>. <code>limit</code> takes an integer as an argument and only shows that many items per outputted database. <code>offset</code> also takes an integer, n, and skips the first n values of the outputted database.</p>

      <p>You must be careful when outputting data after creating new columns as this essentially collapses the database into a new database with one entry for each unique element in the <code>group by</code> column. Requesting information which might have had different values for a single value of the <code>group by</code> column will most likely yield useless results.</p>

      <p>This has been a quick, late evening round-up of sql basics. I'll endevour to add some examples later on as practice but if you're unsure of anything: <a href='http://lmgtfy.com/?q=sql+basics'>sql basics</a>.</p>

      <h3>Git Basics</h3>
      <h4>13:56, Wednesday, April 29, 2015.</h4>

      <p>Highly suggested pre-reading: <a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2009/05/19/the-git-parable.html" target='_blank'>The Git Parable</a>. This 'short-story' will teach you the motivations behind creating and using a version control system. It does a very good job of explaining it and motivating you to use a vcs so take 30 minutes and go it.</p>

      <h3>Semantics</h3>
      <h4>11:38, Tuesday, April 28, 2015.</h4>

      <p>In HTML, certain elements are used that aid in more than making the web page look nice. They help to give meaning to the different parts and texts in the webpage.</p>

      <p id="textBlocks">One such element is the <i>section</i> element. Everything in the certain block of text that is related can be placed into one section so that it is 'held together', so to speak. Another element is the <i>article</i>. This element is used for smaller blocks of text that can be read outside of the rest of the text and still make sense. These elements help search engines categorize our website. Search engines can drive a lot of traffic to your website so play nice.</p>

      <section id="elementPairs">
        <p id="italicize">There are also pairs of elements that appear to do the same thing but actually have slightly different uses. The first that springs to mind are the <i>italicize</i> elements. There are two versions of this. The first only italicizes the contained block of text. It has the element name of <i>i</i>. It is used only when you want to convey a different tone of voice to the reader, almost as if the text had quotes around it. The second version has the element name of <i>em</i>, as in emphasis. This also italicizes the contained text, but it also has a meaning to it. As the name suggests, it gives a stressed emphasis to the word.</p>

        <p id="bolding">The second pair of such elements are the <b>bold</b> elements. The first version simply bolds the contained text. It is purely for offsetting the text and suggests no overly important value of the contained text. It is given the element name of <b>b</b>. The second version also bolds the text but adds a strong importance to the contained text. As such, it's element name is <b>strong</b>.</p>
